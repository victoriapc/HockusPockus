Welcome to the Hockus Pockus Project!

Based on JJRobots's [*Air Hockey Robot Evo*](https://www.jjrobots.com/the-open-source-air-hockey-robot/), this air hockey robot project is realised by Robotics Engineering students at Sherbrooke's University.

## Description

This open source project allows you to make your own air hockey playing robot. Using a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and a computer configured with Ubuntu and ROS Melodic, this robot will challenge you and your friends.  

You can find all the parts used to make the mecanism, the table and the game pieces in the *CADs* section. 

The code includes all of the ROS packages used for the project. In each subfolder, you can find documentation that explains the parameters and how to use the code.

Here is a quick overview of the project (Don't worry, this is the only part of the project that is in french) :

## Wiki

The Wiki of the GitHub contains all of the information needed to reproduce the project. You will find the instructions needed to setup the computer and the Pi, all of material needed and the steps on how to assemble the table and the mecanism. Finally, there are also a few tips on how to use the UI. 

## Last planned Update

The last planned update is on 4/20/2020. No further updates are planned to be added after this date.
