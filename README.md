Welcome to the Hockus Pockus Project!

Based on JJRobots's [*Air Hockey Robot Evo*](https://www.jjrobots.com/the-open-source-air-hockey-robot/), this air hockey robot project is realised by Robotics Engineering students at Sherbrooke's University.

## Description

This open source project allows you to make your own air hockey playing robot. Using a Raspberry Pi 3B+ configured with Ubuntu Mate and ROS Melodic, this robot will challenge you and your friends.  

You can find all the parts used to make the mecanism on [JJRobots's original project](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1804534), and the pieces used to make the table and the game pieces in the *CADs* section. 

The code includes all of the ROS packages used for the project. In each subfolder, you can find documentation that explains the parameters and how to use the code.
